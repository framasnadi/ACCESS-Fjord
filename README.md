# ACCESS-Fjord
Scripts for the ShinyApp developed in the context of the project proposal: _"Advancing Citizen-science and Community engagement for Ecosystem-based fisherieS management in the Sørfolda Fjord"_ in support of the Citizen-Science Engagement Loop:

- Offer participants small “rewards” (certificates, badges, etc.). 

- Show participants how their data contributes to ongoing research (via online dashboard such as Shiny apps https://accessfjordproject.shinyapps.io/test1/ ).
